# 2-dimensional fluid simulations with the Navier-Stokes equation

Simulations of 2-dimensional fluids solving the Navier-Stokes equations.

### To do
- `BoundaryConditions`
    - Implement `BoundaryConditions::applyBCs`
    - Implement possibility to add objects inside the domain
- `NavierStokesSolver`
    - Initialize variables in the constructor 
    - Write the main loop
- Output to a video
    - Save to text files only the data that will appear in the video
