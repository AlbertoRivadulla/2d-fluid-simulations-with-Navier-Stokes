# 2-dimensional fluid simulations with the Navier-Stokes equation

Simulations of 2-dimensional fluids solving the Navier-Stokes equations.

### To do
- `BoundaryConditions`
    - Implement possibility to add objects inside the domain
    - Improve the way in which wall boundary conditions are stored and applied
- `NavierStokesSolver`
    - Write the results to a file
        - The output file will have a header, with: dimensions of the grid, nr of frames,
        frames per second, total time, map of the grid
- Output to a video
    - Save to text files only the data that will appear in the video
